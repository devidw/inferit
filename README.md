_inferit_ is a visual take on llm inference. Most inference frontends are
limited to a single visual input/output "thread". This makes it hard to compare
output from different models, prompts and sampler settings. _inferit_ solves
this with its UI that allows for an unlimited number of side-by-side
generations. This makes it a perfect fit to compare and experiment with
different models, prompts and sampler settings.

Use cases:

- model exploration and comparison
- prompt engineering
- sampler setting optimizations

## run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

## development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Contributions of any kind are warmly welcomed!
